### Setup

#### Mac Setup

In your root directory, create a directory called `.warp/themes` and clone the repo into the `themes` folder:
`ssh`: `git@github.com:mihlali-jordan/warp-themes.git .`
`github-cli`: `gh repo clone mihlali-jordan/warp-themes`
`https`: `https://github.com/mihlali-jordan/warp-themes.git`

Once you have cloned into this folder, you can restart warp and when you select the themes in appearance settings, you will see the additional list of custom themes.
